Howdy, thanks for checking out my site! My name's Matt. I studied statistics in undergrad and currently work as a software engineer. I enjoy cycling, coding, and poker. You can find my contact info at the bottom of this page or leave me anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/matt-zacharski).

The name of this site is inspired from one of my favorite probability thought experiments: [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) 

This site's theme and fun battery functionality are heavily 'borrowed' from [Low←Tech Magazine’s](solar.lowtechmagazine.com) Hugo theme. I first discovered it from reading [this site](https://herecomesthemoon.net/about/).
