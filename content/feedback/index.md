A podcast I listened to a while ago mentioned that people are reluctant to provide honest feedback to others out of some sort of social obligation to not tell someone something they might not enjoy hearing. This is my attempt to sidestep that uneasiness and make it as easy as possible to provide some honest feedback about anything!

One part of life I really enjoy is the feeling of growth in any area. Sometimes this is made possible by some sort of self reflection, but other times it takes some external input to connect the dots required to grow. Which is why I really cherish feedback! Have any sort of feedback, good or bad, for me? Let me know anonymously [here](https://www.admonymous.co/matt-zacharski)!
