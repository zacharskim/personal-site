Great post! I've been slowly transitioning to terminal-based workflows and the productivity gains are real. One tip I'd add: learn `fzf` for fuzzy finding - it's a game changer for navigating directories and command history.

The `.bashrc` aliases section is gold. I'm definitely stealing that `ll='ls -lah'` alias. Have you tried `exa` as a modern replacement for `ls`? It has great colorization and tree views out of the box.

"Unix is user-friendly. It's just very selective about who its friends are." - This quote is perfect! I'm still in the learning phase but articles like this keep me motivated. The bash one-liners you shared are super helpful.

Nice writeup. For anyone else learning, I highly recommend keeping a personal cheat sheet of commands you use frequently. I keep mine in a simple markdown file and grep through it when I forget syntax. Eventually it becomes muscle memory.
