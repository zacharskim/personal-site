# What's the big deal with Matrix Multiplication?

##### Published 1-22-23 | Last Update 1-22-23


Hey, you know what's the big deal with matrix multiplication? Everyone's always talking about it like it's this big, complicated thing, but it's really not that hard to understand.

I mean, sure, it looks fancy when you see it written out with all those symbols and numbers, but all it's really doing is taking two matrices and multiplying them together. That's it. It's just like regular multiplication, but with matrices instead of numbers.

And you know what's even funnier? People get all worked up about the "matrix" part of it, like it's some kind of secret code or something. But a matrix is just a fancy way of saying "grid" or "table". It's just a bunch of numbers arranged in a grid.

But you know what I think the real reason is that people get so worked up about matrix multiplication? It's because it's used in a lot of important stuff like machine learning, computer graphics, and physics. But that doesn't mean it's hard to understand.

So don't let the fancy symbols and big words fool you. Matrix multiplication is just regular multiplication with matrices. It's nothing to be scared of.

And that's the big deal with matrix multiplication.
